Transcript:

Sarah: Today we're talking about families. 

>> 今天我们谈谈家族。

Jack: I see you've got your family <w>album</w> there. 

>> 我看你那里有你的家庭相册。

Sarah: I do! Look how <w>cute</w> I was. 

>> 是的，看，我那时候多可爱。

Jack: <w>Adorable</w>! Well we should probably start by talking about our <w>immediate</w> families. 

>> 太可爱了！好，我们应该可以从谈论我们的直系亲属开始。

Sarah: Fair enough! Well when we talk about our immediate family, we usually mean our <w>partners</w>, our children, our siblings, our parents and maybe our grandparents or grandkids. Your partner could be your husband or wife if you're married. You can also call your husband or your wife your "<w>spouse</w>". If you're not <w>married</w>, but you are in a relationship, you could call your partner your "boyfriend" or "girlfriend". Or if you're not in a <w>relationship</w>, you say: "I'm single". So, I'm single and I don't have any children. 

>> 理解(认同)！ 好了，当我们谈论直系亲属时，我们通常指的是我们的伴侣，我们的孩子，我们的兄弟姐妹，我们的父母，甚至我们的祖父母或孙子孙女。 如果你已婚，你的伴侣可以是你的丈夫或妻子。 你也可以称呼你的丈夫或妻子为“配偶”。 如果你没有结婚，但是有一段恋爱关系，则可以将你的伴侣称为“男朋友”或“女友”。 或者，如果你没有恋爱关系，则说：“我是单身”。 所以，我单身，没有孩子。

Jack: And I don't have any children but I do have a partner who I live with. If you do have children, then you're a parent. We often refer to children as "kids". They could be your <w>biological</w> children which means you <w>conceived</w> or gave birth to them. Or you could have <w>adopted</w> children, <w>foster</w> children or step children. Step children are the children of your partner, who aren't your biological children. If you are a single parent, that means you are <w>raising</w> children on your own. You can have sons who are male or <w>daughters</w> who are female. If you have more than one child, then they are <w>siblings</w>. A <w>male</w> sibling is a brother and a female sibling is a sister. Or you may be the only child.

>> 我没有孩子，但是我有一个与之同住的伴侣。 如果你有孩子，那么你就是父母。 我们通常将儿童称为“孩子”。 他们可能是你的亲生孩子，这意味着你怀孕或生育了他们。 或者，你可能已经收养了孩子，抚养孩子或继子女。 继子女是你伴侣的子女，而不是你的亲生子女。 如果你是单亲父母，则意味着你要自己抚养孩子。 你可以有男性儿子或女性女儿。 如果你有多个孩子，那么他们就是兄弟姐妹。 男性兄弟姐妹是兄弟，女性兄弟姐妹是姐妹。 或者，你可能是唯一的孩子(独生子女)。

Jack: Do you have any siblings, Sarah?

>> Sarah，你有兄弟姐妹吗？

Sarah: I do! Do you want to see them?

>> 我有！ 你想看看他们吗？

Jack: Yes!

>> 好啊！

Sarah: Alright so, I'm the oldest of three children.

>> 好的，我是三个孩子中最大的一个。

Jack: I've got two younger brothers. This is Daniel and this is Luke.

>> 我有两个弟弟。 这是 Daniel，这是Luke。

Sarah: And that's my father and that's my brother.

>> 那是我的父亲，那是我的弟弟。

Jack: "Mum" is another word for mother, your female parent.

>> “妈妈”是母亲(你的女性父母)的另一种说法。

Sarah: And "dad" is another word for father, your male parent.

>> “爸爸”是父亲(你的男性父母)的另一种说法。

Jack: Then there are your grandparents. Your grandmother and your grandfather. Your maternal grandparents are your mother's parents and your paternal grandparents are your father's parents. You could also say my grandparents on my mother's or father's side.

>> 然后，有你的祖父母。 你的祖母和你的祖父。 你的外祖父母是你母亲的父母，而你的祖父母是你父亲的父母。 你也可以说 “母亲那边的祖父母” 或 “父亲那边的祖父母”。

Sarah: Oh and people often call their grandparents different things like Grandma or Grandpa or Grannie and Granddad, or Nan and Pop. To them, you are the grandchild or grandkid; maybe a grandson or a granddaughter.

>> 哦，人们常常称呼祖父母为另外的词，例如：奶奶或爷爷和姥姥或姥爷，或外公和外婆之类的。 对他们来说，你是孙子，也许是孙女。

Jack: Do you have any photos of your grandparents, Sarah?

>> Sarah，你有祖父母的照片吗？

Sarah: Yeah I do, I do. Now this, this is my maternal grandmother and my maternal grandfather. My mother's parents. They used to live in Newcastle in New South Wales. And these are my paternal grandparents. They live in New Zealand.

>> 是的，我有。看，这是我的外祖母和外祖父，我妈妈的父母，他们曾经住在新南威尔士州的纽卡斯尔。这些是我的祖父母，他们住在新西兰。

Jack: How many grandchildren do they have?

>> 他们有几个孙子？

Sarah: My paternal grandparents have only got four. But my mother's parents, they had lots of kids. So they had lots of grandchildren too. Now a family tree is a really good way to <w>represent</w> your family. It shows people's <w>relationships</w> to each other. For example, this is my immediate family. My mother and my father and my two brothers. Now I'm single and I don't have any kids, so it's just me. But my brother has a <w>fiancee</w> so we'll put her in there. Then I can put in my <w>extended</w> family made up of my other <w>relatives</w>. That would be my mum's siblings and their parents and my dad's siblings and their partners. They're all my aunts and uncles. "Aunts" for <w>females</w> and "uncles" for <w>males</w>. And their children are my "cousins". You call them cousins if they're male or if they're <w>female</w>. You could <w>extend</w> your family tree even more to show even more generations of your family. A <w>generation</w> is <w>basically</w> a group of people who were born and lived at the same time.

>> 我的祖父母只有四个。但是我母亲的父母，他们有很多孩子。所以他们也有很多孙子。现在，家谱是表现你家族的好方法。它展示了人与人之间的关系。例如，这是我的直系亲属。我的母亲和父亲以及我的两个兄弟。现在我是单身，没有孩子，所以只有我一个人。但是我弟弟有未婚妻，所以我们把她放在那里。然后，我可以安置由其他亲戚组成的大家庭。那就是我妈妈的兄弟姐妹和他们的父母，还有我爸爸的兄弟姐妹和他们的伴侣。他们都是我的阿姨和叔叔。女性为“阿姨”，男性为“叔叔”。他们的孩子是我的“表兄弟”。无论他们是男性或女性，都可以称他们为表亲。你可以进一步扩展家谱，以展示更多的家族世代。一代人基本上是一组同时出生和生活的人。

Jack: First-generation Australians are people who are born <w>overseas</w> and now live in Australia as <w>citizens</w>. If you are a second- or third-generation Australian, it means you were born in Australia. If people are from different generations, they've often had really different <w>upbringings</w> so they can have really different <w>tastes</w> and sometimes they can have a bit of <w>trouble</w> <w>relating</w> to each other. We call that a "generation <w>gap</w>".

>> 第一代澳大利亚人是在海外出生的人，现在以公民身份居住在澳大利亚。如果您是第二代或第三代澳大利亚人，则意味着您出生于澳大利亚。如果人们来自不同的世代，他们的成长经历通常会非常不同，因此他们的口味可能会非常不同，有时彼此之间可能会遇到麻烦。我们称之为“代沟”。

Sarah: Would you say there's much of a generation gap between you and your parents?

>> 你是否会说你和父母之间存在很大的代沟？

Jack: A bit. For example, my mum doesn't really get <w>social</w> media. But there's an even bigger gap between me and my grandparents. They <w>grew</w> up at a <w>completely</w> different time and they grew up in a <w>country</w> <w>town</w>, so we had pretty different upbringings.

>> 一点儿。例如，我妈妈不怎么使用社交媒体。但是我和祖父母之间的差距更大。他们在完全不同的时间长大，并且在乡村小镇长大，所以我们的成长经历有很大的不同。

Sarah: Do you get to see them very often?

>> 你会经常见到他们吗？

Jack: Not much, I live in a different state. But my mum calls me all the time and I call my grandma <w>every</w> <w>now</w> <w>and</w> <w>again</w> to have a bit of a chat.

>> 不多，我生活在不同的状态。但是我妈妈一直在打电话给我，我不时打电话给奶奶聊会儿天。

Sarah: That's nice.

>> 不错。

Jack: Well that's it's for now!

>> 好吧，就是现在！

Sarah: Try drawing your own family tree and have a look at the <w>similarities</w> and differences between your family and mine.

>> 尝试绘制自己的家谱，并看看你的家人和我的家人之间的异同。

Jack: Thanks for watching! We'll see you next time!

>> 谢谢观看！下回见！
