  "str": "Transcript:\nSarah: Jack you asked me to meet you in the kitchen. What's going on?\n\nJack: Well, today we're talking about cooking so the kitchen seemed like a good place to start.\n\nSarah: Fair enough.\n\nJack: Vocabulary for food and cooking can get technical so it's good to familiarise yourself with some commonly used words. Let's start with a recipe. A recipe is a list of ingredients (things that go into a dish) and instructions showing you how to make it. So, what are we going to make today, Sarah?\n\nSarah: Well, there are recipes for a few different cuisines here. We've got: Japanese, Indian, Italian, Spanish.\n\nJack: How about pasta?\n\nSarah: Italian it is! Now when you look at a recipe you'll see lots of measurements for your ingredients. For example, 250 grams of pasta. 1 and 1/2 a cup of chopped tomatoes. 1/2 a cup of tomato paste. Two pieces of chicken. Some garlic. One tablespoon of oil. A pinch of salt. A bunch of basil. 500 millilitres of water and some parmesan cheese. Have we got everything?\n\nJack: Yep!\n\nSarah: What about cooking utensils?\n\nJack: Yeah, it's good to know the names of some of the tools you'll be using in the kitchen. There's a wooden spoon that you use to stir things. A ladle, a spatula, tongs. Oh, a knife for cutting, slicing and dicing which you do on a chopping board or block. You might use a grater. Oh and then there's measuring cups and spoons.\n\nSarah: Then we have our pots and pans. We've got saucepans, and a wok and a frying pan. We use a frying pan to fry something on a stove. Frying means to cook something in oil in a shallow pan or you can deep fry it using more oil. To fry something quickly is to sauté it. You can also boil something which means to cook it in water. You know it's boiling when it starts to bubble like this. If I turn it down, it's called simmering. You can also cook things in the steam and that's called steaming. Roasting means to cook something in dry heat, usually in an oven. You can also use an oven to bake things like cakes and bread. Or you can grill something by exposing it to heat or you can toast it.\n\nJack: Toast also means cooked bread, which you make in a toaster. Ok Sarah, what does the recipe say?\n\nSarah: It says to boil the water with a pinch of salt and then add the pasta. You can chop the tomatoes and then we have to sauté them.\n\nJack: Should we fry the chicken or roast it?\n\nSarah: Well it says to steam it but I think we should fry it! It'll taste better.\n\nJack: How many pieces of chicken again?\n\nSarah: Two!\n\nJack: And how much oil should I use?\n\nSarah: Just two tablespoons. 'Much' and 'many' are words we use to describe quantity. We use 'how many' when you can count something. For example: How many tomatoes? How many carrots? We use 'much' when we can't count something. For example: How much salt? Or, how much oil? You can also use 'some' and 'lots of'. Lots of is more than some.\n\nJack: We need lots of cheese grated on top.\n\nSarah: You can also say a 'little' or a 'little bit' which is less than 'some'.\n\nJack: I'm just going to add a little bit of salt to this.\n\nSarah: A bit of parmesan to garnish.\n\nJack: Looks great.\n\nSarah: There we go! Well now we've done all this hard work it's time to eat.\n\nJack: See you next time!",
