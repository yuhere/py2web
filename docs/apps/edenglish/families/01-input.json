  "str": "Transcript:\nSarah: Today we're talking about families.\n\nJack: I see you've got your family album there.\n\nSarah: I do! Look how cute I was.\n\nJack: Adorable! Well we should probably start by talking about our immediate families.\n\nSarah: Fair enough! Well when we talk about our immediate family, we usually mean our partners, our children, our siblings, our parents and maybe our grandparents or grandkids. Your partner could be your husband or wife if you're married. You can also call your husband or your wife your 'spouse'. If you're not married, but you are in a relationship, you could call your partner your 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend'. Or if you're not in a relationship, you say: 'I'm single'. So, I'm single and I don't have any children.\n\nJack: And I don't have any children but I do have a partner who I live with. If you do have children, they you're a parent. We often refer to children as 'kids'. They could be your biological children which means you conceived or gave birth to them. Or you could have adopted children, foster children or step children. Step children are the children of your partner, who aren't your biological children. If you are a single parent, that means you are raising children on your own. You can have sons who are male or daughters who are female. If you have more than one child, then they are siblings. A male sibling is a brother and a female sibling is a sister. Or you may be the only child.\n\nJack: Do you have any siblings, Sarah?\n\nSarah: I do! Do you want to see them?\n\nJack: Yes!\n\nSarah: Alright so, I'm the oldest of three children.\n\nJack: I've got two younger brothers. This is Daniel and this is Luke.\n\nSarah: And that's my father and that's my brother.\n\nJack: 'Mum' is another word for mother, your female parent.\n\nSarah: And 'dad' is another word for father, your male parent.\n\nJack: Then there are your grandparents. Your grandmother and your grandfather. Your maternal grandparents are your mother's parents and your paternal grandparents are your father's parents. You could also say my grandparents on my mother's or father's side.\n\nSarah: Oh and people often call their grandparents different things like Grandma or Grandpa or Grannie and Granddad, or Nan and Pop. To them, you are the grandchild or grandkid; maybe a grandson or a granddaughter.\n\nJack: Do you have any photos of your grandparents, Sarah?\n\nSarah: Yeah I do, I do. Now this, this is my maternal grandmother and my maternal grandfather. My mother's parents. They used to live in Newcastle in New South Wales. And these are my paternal grandparents. They live in New Zealand.\n\nJack: How many grandchildren do they have?\n\nSarah: My paternal grandparents have only got four. But my mother's parents, they had lots of kids. So they had lots of grandchildren too. Now a family tree is a really good way to represent your family. It shows people's relationships to each other. For example, this is my immediate family. My mother and my father and my two brothers. Now I'm single and I don't have any kids, so it's just me. But my brother has a fiancee so we'll put her in there. Then I can put in my extended family made up of my other relatives. That would be my mum's siblings and their parents and my dad's siblings and their partners. They're all my aunts and uncles. 'Aunts' for females and 'uncles' for males. And their children are my 'cousins'. You call them cousins if they're male or if they're female. You could extend your family tree even more to show even more generations of your family. A generation is basically a group of people who were born and lived at the same time.\n\nJack: First-generation Australians are people who are born overseas and now live in Australia as citizens. If you are a second- or third-generation Australian, it means you were born in Australia. If people are from different generations, they've often had really different upbringings so they can have really different tastes and sometimes they can have a bit of trouble relating to each other. We call that a 'generation gap'.\n\nSarah: Would you say there's much of a generation gap between you and your parents?\n\nJack: A bit. For example, my mum doesn't really get social media. But there's an even bigger gap between me and my grandparents. They grew up at a completely different time and they grew up in a country town, so we had pretty different upbringings.\n\nSarah: Do you get to see them very often?\n\nJack: Not much, I live in a different state. But my mum calls me all the time and I call my grandma every now and again to have a bit of a chat.\n\nSarah: That's nice.\n\nJack: Well that's it's for now!\n\nSarah: Try drawing your own family tree and have a look at the similarities and differences between your family and mine.\n\nJack: Thanks for watching! We'll see you next time!",
